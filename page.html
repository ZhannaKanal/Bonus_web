                  <h5>NAURYZ HOLIDAY</h5>
                  <p>It is a holiday of spring, renewal of nature, the beginning of a new year, a new life. 
                      According to Tengrian beliefs, Nauryz is considered the beginning of the New Year and is celebrated on March 22 on the day of the vernal equinox.
                      Like the rest of the great feasts, Nauryz consists of many small rituals and customs. 
                      The holiday begins at dawn when all the inhabitants of the village or aul come out together to plant trees under the guidance of aksakals.
                      After the trees are planted, everyone gathers for the celebration. 
                      People have fun, congratulate each other on New Year's Eve, and wish each other peace, prosperity, richness, and happiness. 
                      Songs composed especially for this holiday — Nauryz Zhyr — are performed.
                       Sports competitions are held: kures wrestling, racing — baiga. 
                        Often in the middle of the village, there are big swings for children and youth. 
                        There are also intellectual contests for solving poetic riddles and contests in short sayings.  </p>

                  <h5>TUSAU KESU</h5>
                  <p>For the Kazakh family, children are the most important treasure, so their growth and upbringing are associated with a huge number of rituals and traditions. 
                      This is either laying in the cradle, naming, and, of course, one of the most important customs for a child — Tusau Kesu, or cutting the ties.
                       This ceremony is held when the child starts taking his first steps.
                    A child's legs are tied with a thin, colorful cord, which is cut by an energetic man with many children, a respected aksakal (elder, a venerable elderly man), or a dear important guest. The cord, which is used to tie the legs of the baby, traditionally consists of black and white threads. 
                    It means that in life there are not only white but also black stripes — the future dzhigit (a young man) must be able to overcome difficulties.
                    The ritual is accompanied by songs and wishes (bata), so that the child stood firmly on his feet, confidently walked through life. After cutting the ties, usually followed the toy: a holiday with a feast, contests, songs, and music competitions. 
                    After Tusau keser, a child used to get a horse and saddle, today they are limited to expensive gifts or money. </p>

                  <h5>AITYS</h5>
                  <p>Aitys is one of the obligatory parts of the holiday program of any Kazakh holiday. It is a poetic-musical competition of the Kazakh singers-improvisers.
                    During the aitys, the performers sit or stand in front of each other and start a kind of song dialogue, constantly passing the word to each other, continuing the theme started by the opponent. Aitys can be held on any arbitrary theme. According to the results of the competition, the winner is chosen.
                     The jury consisting of distinguished people or guests of the festival evaluates not only the musicality and performing talent, but also the skill in parrying the arguments of the opponent, humor, and ingenuity.
                    Aitys is somewhat reminiscent of modern rap battles: the same principle is used in the order of performance and the evaluation of participants.
                    Several akyns can take part in aitys, although paired performances are more traditional. Aitys is often held between a man and a woman. For example, in 1946, Kazakh composer Mukan Tulebayev wrote the opera “Birzhan and Sarah” based on aitys between famous akyns of the XIX century Birzhan-sal and Sarah Tastanbekkyzy.</p>
